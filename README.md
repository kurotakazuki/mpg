# Minimal Parser Generator
This is minimal parser generator that generates a parser from grammar like Top-Down Parsing Language (TDPL). The generated parser creates an abstract syntax tree (AST) for each input.

## MPG
### Definition of MPG grammar
A MPG grammar `G` is a tuple `G = (V, T, R, S, $)` in which:
- `V` is a finite set of variables.
- `T` is a finite set of terminal symbols.
- `R` is a finite set of rules of the form
    - `A = B C / D`  
    A in V (A &isin; V),  
    B, C, D in E (E = V &cup; T &cup; {(), f}) (V &cap; T = V &cap; {(), f} = T &cap; {(), f} = &empty;) (B, C, D &isin; E).  
    For any variable A there is at most one rule with A to the left of the `=`.
- S in V (S &isin; V) is the start variable.
- $ not in E ($ &notin; E) is the end symbol.

### Extended MPG
Since one of the goals of MPG is to create an AST, it also supports two features in terms of ease of use and speed.

#### Any
`?` is a symbol representing any single input like wildcard character. This succeeds if there is any input left, and fails if there is no input left.

```
integer: i32 = ???? () / f
```

To extend the difinition of MPG grammar, change {(), f} to {?, (), f}.

#### Variable type
Variables can have a type.

If the variable contains a type, it will include the value of that type when you create the AST. Therefore rules decomposed from variable including rule has a role like lexical analysis. The following syntax is a lexical syntax for numbers.

```
number: String = digit numeral / f
numeral = digit numeral / ()
digit = zero () / f
zero = "0" () / one
one = "1" () / two
// ...
nine = "9" () / f
```

An error (TODO: maybe failure would be better) will occur if the input cannot be converted to the variable type.

To extend the difinition of MPG grammar, change `A = B C / D` to `A = B C / D` or `A: TYPE = B C / D`, or seperate definition of `V` by including type or not.

#### Terminal symbol type
Terminal symbols supports several types.

```
a = b'A' "abc" / 123
```

## Difference between TDPL and MPG
The biggest difference between the two grammars is the rule form. There are two rule forms in TDPL.

> `A..BC/D`, A,B,C,D in V.  
> `A..a`, a in &sum; &cup; {&epsilon;, f}, f is a metasymbol not in &sum; and &epsilon; is the null string.

MPG, on the other hand, has one rule form.
